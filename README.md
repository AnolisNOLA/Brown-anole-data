Description:  
Organized by sheets within the Excel document. Variables will be defined once and only mention on subsequent use. New variables will be defined as used.

1) All blood pb: a record of all field-blood lead levels documented in wild-caught brown anoles. Does not include lead-dosed anoles. Unavailable data is left blank.

5) Sagrei field balance: Balance and blood lead levels for field-caught brown anoles in 2021
•	ID, location, soil, sex, SVL, mass, T1, T2, Tavg, DateC, dryblood, bloodpb
•	Knee: Interdistance between knees (mm)
•	Beam: Diameter of beam (cm)
•	Slip1: Number of times individual slipped during Run1
•	Slip2: Number of times individual slipped during Run2
•	TotSlip: Total number of slips between Runs 1 and 2
•	Ttot: Total time to run across beam between Runs 1 and 2
6) Sagrei field sprint: Sprint speed and blood lead levels for field-caught brown anoles in 2021
•	ID, location, soil, sex, SVL, mass, DateC
•	Frames1: Total number of frames it took the individual to go from one line to the next during Run1
•	Speed1: Frames1 divided by 12.5 (cm), the total distance between the lines
•	Frames2: Total number of frames it took the individual to go from one line to the next during Run2
•	Speed2: Frames2 divided by 12.5 (cm), the total distance between the lines
•	AvgSpeed: Average time (seconds) of Speed1 and Speed2
•	Speed (cm/s): 12.5cm divided by the AvgSpeed
•	Speed: Speed (cm/s) divided by 100 for final speed in m/s
•	BestFrame: Fastest sprint speed based on lowest number of frames
•	BestSpeed: Calculated like Speed1 for BestFrame
•	Best (cm/s): Calculed like Speed (cm/s)
•	Fastest: fastest sprint speed (m/s) for an individual
•	Fastest: fastest 
7) Sagrei dosing endurance: Endurance and blood lead levels for lead-dosed brown anoles in 2023
•	ID, SVL, mass, knee, t1, t2
•	Treatment: treatment group an individual was in, based on daily lead dose (mg/kg)
•	Massfinal: last mass measurement recorded (g)
•	Massdiff: difference in mass (g) between the first (mass) and final (massfinal) measurements
•	T3: Time (seconds) of third run
•	T4: Time (seconds) of fourth run
•	Tavg1: Average Time (seconds) of T1 and T2
•	Tavg2: Average Time (seconds) of T3 and T4
•	T5: Time (seconds) of fifth run
•	T6: Time (seconds) of sixth run
•	Tavg3: Average Time (seconds) of T5 and T6
•	Run: Run number (1, 2, or 3)
